photographer_bio: "Sebastião Nascimento has spent 25 years documenting life in the Amazon Basin, following the footsteps of his grandmother who taught him the language of the rivers. Born in a small riverine community near Manaus, his intimate knowledge of the region and fluency in Portuguese and four indigenous languages have earned him unprecedented trust among traditional communities. His work centers on the intersection of indigenous wisdom and environmental change, capturing both the resilience and vulnerability of Amazon peoples. Nascimento's approach combines deep cultural respect with technical mastery, creating images that speak to both local experience and global consciousness. His previous series on traditional fishing practices and forest medicine have been exhibited internationally, but he considers this documentation of the drought crisis his most urgent work."
